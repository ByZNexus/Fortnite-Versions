## Project Mercury

| [Mercury](https://discord.gg/QufwNeE436) | One of the few to offer Fortnite Alpha! You can play Online Test 6.5 with this although it is pretty old and outdated.

## Project Rift

| [Rift](https://github.com/ByZNexus/Rift-Archive) | This project is **DISCONTINUED** since 2023, Seasons from 0 to 15 should work fine but most C2 builds doesn't support editing and builds before 4.5 might have a login issue. Get Rift 2.1.0.X to fix the issue or use [Reboot](https://discord.gg/rebootmp) that's more stable and updated regularly

## Carbon

| - | - |
| [Carbon](https://discord.gg/VbQdXyfdQu) | Useful for builds above 23.00 (Chapter 4) Unfortunatly you cannot play with friends and there's some building delay but is still really good to explore the map and other stuff like events and more..

## Project Nocturno

| [Nocturno](https://discord.gg/MQVyqqKgrb) | The only server to support Save The World ! Will soon support Multiplayer but for now you can play STW on 1.8 primarly but also Online Test 6.5. 

**NOTE : THIS IS NOT A WAY TO PLAY SAVE THE WORLD FOR FREE AND YOU WILL SOON REQUIRE AN EPIC GAMES ACCOUNT THAT OWNS SAVE THE WORLD TO USE NOCTURNO**
